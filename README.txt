node-typescript boilerplate
---------------------------------------

highly opinionated boilerplate for node and typescript projects.

* uses yarn
* nodemon integration
* debugger configured (run `yarn dev:debug` and attach to it using vscode)
* includes ts-dotenv (rename .env.sample to .env)
* includes husky, lint-staged, prettier and eslint with typescript support
  for better code-style consistency across the project
